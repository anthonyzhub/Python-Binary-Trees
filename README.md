# Python-Binary-Trees

This Python program creates a binary tree and prints it in any traversal order. As a reminder:

1. Preorder: Root => Left => Right
2. Postorder: Left => Right => Root
3. Inorder: Left => Root => Right

For demonstration purposes, an illustration of the tree is provided inside the Python file as a comment.
